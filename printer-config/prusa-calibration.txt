240/100
draft shield at 10mm distance
10% fan starting @ layer 5
25% on bridging
42 C chamber
smooth PEI


ringing on Y
overextrusion on top
underextrusion (lack of squish?) on first layer
poor adhesion on first layer
belt X254 / Y275 (dont trust this)
overhangs are warped (?)
some bubbling(?) on the draft shield

tensioned Y belt until it strums
belt test now gives X270 / Y270

printing an XYZ test cube
failed draft shield adhesion
failed draft shield adhesion again
front door might have gotten leakier?

disabled draft shield
skirt lifts at layer 3, before fan turns on
first layer shrinks significantly, very little squish

ran first layer zcal
0.75 -> 1.00
some bubbling(?) on the first layer test patch

try XYZ cube again, this time again with draft shield
ringing is better and more even between X and Y
overhangs still poor
too much extrusion on first layer - lines are merged, significant elephants foot
overextrusion on top layer

ecorrect is currently off. running ECOR_TOWER...
ECOR = 0 is fine

zcal / extrusion multiplier tests:
0.90 / 0.90
0.90 / 0.95
0.90 / 1.00
0.90 / 0.93 <- this is the lowest multiplier without top layer gaps
0.90 z offset still has poor adhesion, increasing to 0.95


single wall vase mode test
0.95 zcal
0.93 extrusion multiplier
measures 0.36 mm -> extrusion multiplier should be 1.03 (0.93 * 0.4 / 0.36)

voron guide says:
A good starting point is 240C hotend temperature, 100C heated bed temperature, and 92% flow for ABS.

still having overhang trouble

first layer looks a little tall
z offset 0.95 -> 1 mm (maybe it's okay now with a lower extrusion multiplier)
try printing a cube w/o heating
temp is around 35
severe warping on draft shield, cube is slightly worse
suggests the trouble with overhangs is actually curling
confirmed, the proble areas are curling up rather than drooping down
first layer seems good with 1 mm offset

try w/ heat w/o fan
saw warping already on the webcam at 17% complete

remove exhaust
worse - it's definitely a need for cooling

warp is different from curling

test:
chamber 55
fan always on, 30%
no vent
turned out super good! still a tiny bit of curling

upped cooling to 50%
